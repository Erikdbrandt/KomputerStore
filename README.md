# KomputerStore


## what it does
This projects creates a small website that can simulate a store where you can buy computers. To buy the computers you need to work and maybe take a loan. The loan should be repayed before another loan is made. 


## What languages and technology I use
For this project I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript. The data about the computers are fetched with a API


## First project on noroff fulstack developer course

This is the first project I have done in Javascript. I think it went well, all the functionality is there I hope.
What I could improve is the modularity of the Javascript code. I will try to start implementing this in my next project.
